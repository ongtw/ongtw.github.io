To blog about:

Python Kivy
- kv file: root widget vs classes, widget traversal self.parent
- kv file: python code to access widgets declared in kv file
- kv file: button on_press/on_release vs on_touch_down/on_touch_up (on_touch_up triggered twice(?))
- kv file: using class/functions in python code behind - on_press to callback event continuously
- kv file: bind button text to variable in python code
- remove specific instructions from canvas
- add backgrounds to widgets
- handle input: mouse down/up, mouse over
- volume button label class: pictorial view of volume level
- quirks: pygame mixer plays mp3 slow -> need to resample to 44100Hz using Audacity
