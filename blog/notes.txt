To blog about:

Python Kivy
- kv file root object vs classes
- access widgets declared in kv file from Python code
- on_press to callback event continuously
- remove specific instructions from canvas
- add backgrounds to widgets
- handle input: mouse down/up, mouse over
- button in kv file: on_press/on_release vs on_touch_down/on_touch_up (on_touch_up triggered twice(?))
